# Intro

I am currently taking a break to focus on my studies, but I’m eager to return to the field. I believe in giving my best in everything I do—showing up, putting in the effort, and making the most out of every opportunity. This philosophy has guided me throughout my journey in technology, invention, and personal growth.

I also believe that no one possesses absolute knowledge. Everyone, no matter how skilled, is still missing something. This mindset keeps me grounded, curious, and always open to learning more. It fuels my drive for continuous improvement and innovation.

# Some History

* My fascination with technology began when my dad brought home a desktop computer when I was just four years old. I was immediately captivated by it. A defining moment came when our computer was hit by ransomware. I couldn’t stop wondering how something like that was built and how it could impact someone’s life so drastically.
* Later, Facebook grabbed my attention. The idea that people could connect globally through a single platform blew my mind and planted the seed for my future ambitions—building things with a global impact.
* I began tinkering with electronics and servers at a young age. What started as small experiments turned into complex projects that taught me the fundamentals of engineering and problem-solving.
* As I grew older, I kept pushing boundaries—building websites, designing inventions, and exhibiting my work worldwide. This passion to create has never faded; it’s only evolved.

# Skills & Experience

* My inventions and the recognition they’ve received are milestones I’m deeply proud of. With two patents and multiple international awards, my work reflects years of creativity, persistence, and problem-solving.
* Through internships and collaborations, I’ve gained valuable experience working with teams from diverse backgrounds. These experiences have shaped not only my teachnical skills but also my ability to communicate effectively and adapt quickly.
* I’m passionate about building solutions that have a real impact—whether it’s streamlining processes, solving a complex challenge, or introducing innovative products.

# Zeus – My Guardian and Companion

Zeus, my Belgian Malinois, isn’t just a pet—he’s my right hand when it comes to protection and companionship.

He’s a powerful, highly intelligent working dog with intense energy and drive. Training Zeus has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. It’s taught me patience, consistency, and the importance of clear communication—qualities that translate directly into my work and leadership style.

Zeus is more than a guardian for my home; he’s a loyal partner who has been there through my toughest days and proudest moments. Raising and training a dog like him requires discipline and respect, and it has shaped me just as much as I’ve shaped him.

# Hobbies and Interests

* I’m passionate about electronics, servers, and building reliable systems. My home setup includes a fully self-managed server infrastructure that I’ve built and maintained over the years.
* I also enjoy projects that merge my interests in technology and entertainment. For example, I’ve set up a home media server using Plex, combining my technical skills with my love for movies and anime.
* Outside of tech, I enjoy driving, working on my BMW 335i, and spending time outdoors—whether at the beach or on a late-night drive.
* Training Zeus is both a responsibility and a passion, and I consider it part of my daily lifestyle.

# Travel / Geography

* I’ve traveled to Turkey, France, Italy, Switzerland, and Kuwait. These experiences have broadened my perspective and inspired my approach to work and life.
* Turkey’s balance of modernity and tradition has always fascinated me, while Switzerland’s precision and design reflect values I bring into my own projects.
* My travels have also deepened my appreciation for culture, diversity, and innovation.

# Fun Facts

* I’m a coffee enthusiast and have a morning ritual that helps me start my day focused and energized.
* Beirut’s contrast between vibrant nightlife and the peacefulness of the sea resonates with me. I often go to the beach to clear my mind and recharge.
* My daily life involves balancing studies, projects, and quality time with Zeus, which keeps me grounded and motivated.

# Dreams and Aspirations

* Professionally, my goal is to become a leading engineer capable of managing teams, developing world-class software, and pushing the limits of what technology can achieve.
* Personally, I want to build a secure future, travel the world, and create a meaningful life for myself and those I care about—including Zeus.

# Inspirational Figures

I draw inspiration from innovators like Nikola Tesla, Hasan Kamel Al Sabbah, and Albert Einstein. I also admire creators like Eiichiro Oda, whose ability to craft complex and meaningful worlds inspires me to approach problem-solving with creativity and depth.


# My Vision

I believe technology should do more than solve problems—it should inspire and enrich lives. My goal is to create solutions that leave a lasting, positive impact on the world.
